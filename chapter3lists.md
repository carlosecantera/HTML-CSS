## Lists

*There are three different kinds of lists.*

* Ordered lists -each item on the list is numbered for example steps of a process.
* Unordered lists -Bullet points.
* Defenition lists -Term with explanation/defenition of that term.

## Ordered List

* An ordered list is created using < ol >.
* In between the ordered list to begin a list item use < li > for each item within that ordered list.

## Unordered List

* To begin an unordered list start by using the < ul > element.
* In between the unordered list tage you will use < li > to start bullet points.

## Definition Lists

* To create a definition list start with < dl > and then put the term being defined in between < dt > and the definition itself in < dd >.

## Nested List

* If you want to put a list within a list **nested list** type the < ul > list tag and then start each word in the list using < li > and make sure to close it.
