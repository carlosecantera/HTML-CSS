## Structure

 *Webpages use structure to give information in a form of order.  Very similar to when writing a paper using a word processor.*

1. HTML code is made of characters that live inside angle brackets.
 "< html > < /html >" - These are called HTML elements. One is open the other is closed due to the slash inside the bracket. Everything is written in between these brackets.

2. Inside the HTML brackets are the Body "< body >" ,Main heading "< h1 >", subheading "< h2 >", and paragraghs "< p >". (note the spaces in the brackets, when writing HTML do not have the spaces in the brackets)

3. Attributes are made of two parts "name and value.  For instance < p lang = "en - us "> would show the name is the language (lang) and the value would be what language is being used (us-english).  Attributes give you more information about the contents of an element.  The name and value are seperated by an "=" sign.

4. Body, Head, and Title

- Body -This is where headings and paragrghs live.
- Head -Normally this comes before the body.  This tells what is going on, on the pages versus what is in the information given on the pages like the text.
- Title -The title is normally within the head of the page.  The title is what shows on the tab of the  page when it is open.
