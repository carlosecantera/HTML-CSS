## Understanding CSS

To make sense of CSS you have to picture that all the information that is in each HTML element is enclosed in a box.  Each individual box can be manipulated by using CSS.  With CSS you create rules in those boxes and that controls how that box is supposed to be presented.

**For a CSS rule to work it has to have two parts.  A selector and a declaration.**

- The selector indicates which element in your HTMl the rule applies to.
- The declaration indicated how that element should act.
- You must put the declaration in { } and seperate each rule with a ;
- The CSS doesn't have to be written in the HTML.  You can have it under all the HTML 
- You can write your CSS on a different page and use the < link > element to let your html know where to find the rules.

# External CSS

**href** - Specifies the route to the CSS file
**type** - Specifies the type of document being link to.
**rel** - Specifies the relationship between the HTML and the file it is linked to.

# INternal CSS

**< style >** - Allows you to use CSS within the HTML itself.
