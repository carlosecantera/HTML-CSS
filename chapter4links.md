# Links

## Writing Links

* Links are created by using < a >.  Everything that gives the user the ability to use the link goes inside the < a > element. 

**example** < a href="(the link)" > the text you want the user to see< /a >
When putting in where the customer will be sent be more specific instead of stating click here.
