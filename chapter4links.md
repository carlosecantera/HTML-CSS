# Links

## Writing Links

* Links are created by using < a >.  Everything that gives the user the ability to use the link goes inside the < a > element. 

**example** < a href="(the link)" > the text you want the user to see< /a >
When putting in where the customer will be sent be more specific instead of stating click here. 

## Directory Structure

Most websites should have a directory stucture or an organization by placing all code pages of different sections of the website in different folders.  These folders are generally called directories.

There are three different parts of the directory. 

 * Structure -This is the root folder where the whole project is kept
 * Relationship -This is the relationship between the main directory folder and the folders within that folder.
 * Homepages -This is written in HTML and its child folder is called index.html
