# Chapter 1 The ABC's of Programming

## What is a script

- A script is essentially a form of instructions that a computer can understand  It would be the instruction manual of how something is supposed to be built and act.  When it comes to building your script it has to be very precise as the computer follows only the instructions you give it.  Unlike a person you need to give step by step guidance in order for the machine to act the way you want it to.  If you do not give precise information an important step may be missed and the outcome will not be what you intended it to be.

**Three steps to writing a script**

- Figure out what you are trying to accomplish.
- Designing the script is the next step.  You can do this in a way that each step is individually planned out in the order it needs to go in so that you can get to your goal.
- Lastly each individual step in the language that the computer needs to be able to understand it.  

** In order to become fluent in a coding language you need to be able to undertands the **vocabulary** and the **syntax**.

Vocabulary - The are the words that you need to code in that the computer understands and can execute.

Syntax - Is essentially the grammar of the coding language.  Where to put what where so the instructions are understood by the computer.

## Objects and Properties

- Objects - These are the "things" with in the code.
- Properties - These are how those things look act act like and are specific to the object.

## Event

- An event is a way for a computer to let you know that something has happened.  An exaple would be if you press a button it generates the next step of the process or signals you of the event.

## Method

- When a code is run you need to understand what the result is after the task is complete.

## How HTML, CSS and JavaScript work together

- HTML displays the content that the developer is trying to convey, CSS gives the content in HTML style and makes it look more like a site instead of just words on a page. JavaScript give the page its behavior such as when you click on a button it takes you to a different page within the site or brings up a form.

**When creating JavaScript you want to create it on it's own page.  You will then link it to you HTML so it draws the instructions from your JS file.
