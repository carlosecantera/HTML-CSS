## Insterting an image

* When inserting an image use the < img > element.  Inside that element you want the browser to know where to call that imgae from.  You would use src= and in "" you would let it know what directory to pull it from and the image name after the "" if you want to give a description of the photo you would add alt= and in "" you would give the description.  You can also title the image so if the cursor hovers over the image it shows a title for the photo.  You would do this by adding title= and in "" you would add the title.

## Height and Width of the Image

- Within the < img > element you can add the height and width of the photo.  Use the height= and width= to determine what size you want your picture to be.

## Where to place your image.

-There are three places you can set your image.

* Before a paragragh
* Inside the start of a paragragh
* In the middle of a paragragh

- It's important to know where to put the image depending on whether it is a block or inline element. Block elements always start on a new line. Inline sit in a block level element and do not start on a new line.

- Controlling where the image is should be done in CSS but can be used in HTML by using the element align="" and insert either right or left on the "".

* Left aligns the image to the left and the words flow to the right
* Right aligns the image to the right and the words flow to the left.
* Top aligns the first sentence of the text at the top of the image.
* Middle aligns the first sentence to the middle of the image.
* Bottom aligns the first sentence to the bottom of the image.

**The above functions are old code and should be used sparingly as they can be controlled with CSS.  Some old websites still use it instaed of CSS.**
