# Process and Desing

**The idea behind process and design is to make sure you are building a site that is consistently inline with the audience that will be using it.  There are many different things to think about when creating your site whether is is for a specific age range, where they live or if it's for individuals or a business.

## Things to think about when creating a site

- While some people may stumble across you site by accident you will still want to make your site targeted.  Individuals will need a reason to visit you site whther it is to gather information or just to browse and shop.

- It is important to make sure you have informative data for the people visiting your site.  If you lack the information that the user is looking for then it can affect how often a user visits your site.  Make sure the information is relavent to what your site is about.

## Site map

- A site map will give you an idea on how your page is structure.  It can be built like a tree with branches so you know what information needs to go where so that the site functions seamlessly and the user can gather the information they seek easily.

## Wireframe

- It is best practice when thinking up a site to have a wireframe.  A wireframe is essentially a sketch of what you want the website to look like.  Where things will go so you have an idea in your head.  It doesn't necessarly mean that the website will look like your sketch but it give you a roadmap or guide as to where to start. 

## Using design

- When desinging your website you need to make sure that you are bulding it in a way that a user is able to navigate easily.  If a user has to go searching for the information there is a possibility they may opt to go elsewhere to find the information they seek.  Making sure the site is visually pleasing to the eye and is user intuitive is key.  Make sure the content you are providing is relavent and organize it in a way that information is easy for the user to find.  Make different parts of the page look more distict that others so as to not confuse the user as to how to get to where they need to go.  For example use different kinds of buttons to help the user know which button goes to what.
