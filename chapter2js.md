# Basic JavaScript Instructions

## Statements

- So a computer can understand waht you are trying to accomplish you have to write instructions that a computer can understand.  Each individual instruction or step is referred to as a statement.  After every statement is made you must end it with a semicolon to let the computer know that the step it just made is over and it should then go onto the next step.  Keep in mind that Javascript is case sensitive.  When writing your statements each statment must start on a new line.

- To make sure you and someone else that may be revieweing your code it is a good idea to write comments letting yourself or another person know what that specific code is supposed to do.  In order to write in a comment press command and the forward slash and it will default to comment for a single line comment. If you are going to leave a multiline comment use the "/* and */"  Be descriptive when writing your comment.

## Variables

- A variable is a set of instructions that are stored in order for the computer to perform the set of rules you want it to follow.

## How to Declare a variable and Assign a Value

- Before you are able to execute variable you must call on it to use it. First you must use a key word such as "var". This way JavaScript knows that it is creating a variable. You must give the variable a name or an identifier.  If you name the variable you can use one word but if the variable name is more than one word you need to use camelCase.  camelCase is when you capitalize the first letter of each word after the first word.

-Once your variable has been named you need to give it a value.  This is the code that the variable will call on when it is in use.

## Data types

- **There are three types of data types**

- Numeric Data Type - This kind of data type deals with numbers.
- String Data Type - This data type deals with letters and other characters.
- Boolean Data Type - This data type deals with "true" or "false"
