# Tables

## Basic Table Stucture

- To crate a table use the < table > element open and closed
- Within the table element use < tr > known as table row by each number you want in the table.  This builds the table horizontal.
- Each cell of a table is represented using the < td> element 

## Table headings

- < th > or table headings allows you to put headings above the different table information.  You can determine if it goes in a row or column by using the scope="" and enter either row or column to tell it in which direction it goes.

## Long Tables

- To create a long table you want to use a table head < thead >
- The body of the table should sit inside th < tobody >
- The footer of the table is set to < tfoot >
