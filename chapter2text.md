## Text

*Tags also known as "markups" provide extra meaning to and allow browsers to show the proper structure of the page.*

1.There are two different kinds of Markups.

- Structual -These describe the heading and paragraghs.
- Semantic -These provide extra information such as emphasis in a sentence.

## **Structural markups**
1.Headings -There are six levels of headings from  < h1 > - < h6 >.  The higher the number the smaller the heading.

2.Paragraghs -If creating a paragragh make sure to put the text between < p > and < / p >.  When finished with a paragraghs start a new paragragh in the same manner.

3.Bold and Italics -enclosing a word between < b > and < / b > will make that word bold or < i > and < / i > will make the word italic.

4.Superscript or Subscript -Supersript < sup > allows you to put an exponent above a number or word and Subscript < sub > allows you to put and exponent under a number or word.  Make sure to use a closing tag as well.

5.Line Breaks and Horizontal rules - You can add a line break in a paragragh by entering a < br />between the text that you want to break up from the paragragh. If you want to break up a paragragh and insert a line you would use the < hr /> for a horizontal line between text.

## **Semantic markups**

1.Strong and emphasis -To bolden a word to make it more strong you would add an open and closed  mark up using < strong > to subtly change the meaning of a sentence you may want to emphasize a word within the text by using the markup of < em >.

2.Quotations -Sometimes a quote can be longer than a sentence.  In this instance making a block quote would be appropriate to block it sperately within the paragragh so it stands out. Use < q > for shorter quotes.

3.Abbreviations and Acronymns -If an acronym or abbreviation is used  < abbr > should be used to list what that abv or acronym means. For example < acronym title="Proffesor">Prof< /aacronym>

4.Citations and Definitions - To cite text when doing research you would use the < cite> open and closed. You would only use the define if it is the first time in the text that you are defining something such as a word using the < dfn > tag open and closed around the word you are trying to define.

5.Author details -If contact information such as an email is going to be inserted as a hyperlink the < address > mark up would be used.

6.Changes to content -If you want to remove text you can put it into < del > open and closed and then insert a word after using the < ins > open and closed.  If you want to just mark a word out an < s > opened and closed would be used.
