## Specifying Typefaces

- font-family - This allows you to choice the typeface that you will be using in your elements.  The type face has to be one that is installed on the user's computer so you should sperate different typefaces with a comma to be read on any computer.

- font-size - Font sizes are specified in three different way.  Pixels, percentages, and EMS.

- @font-face - If a specific font size is not installed on the user computer, this will allow you to copy a link path to that specific font so it can then be seen on the user's computer.

- font-weight - This controls how bold the text on the page is.  It can be set to either bold or normal.

- font-style - This allows you to set the kind of italics you want.  Three different kinds of italics are normal, italic, and oblique.

- text-transform - This allows you to make your text all uppercase, lowercase, of capitalize **this makes the first let of each word capital**.

- text-decoration - This allows you to change the decoration of your text using none **removes any decoration** underline, overline, line-through,, and blink **this makes the text blink or flash on the page**.

- line-height -This adjust the veritcal line height of the text in relation to the words above it.

- letter-spacing This allows you to put a specific amount of space between letters in a word.  

- word-spacing - This is the same thing as letter spacing except it is the space between words.

- text-align - This allows you to align the text in four different directions; left, right, center, and justify **This allows the text to take up the whole page with the exception of the last line**.

- vertical-align - This is to help align images to the text not the text to the image.
